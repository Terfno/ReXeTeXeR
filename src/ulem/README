  The ulem package provides various types of underlining that can stretch
  between words and be broken across lines in LaTeX or plain TeX.
  In LaTeX ulem replaces italics with underlining in \em-phasized text.
  A declaration of \normalem (or the \usepackage option "normalem") restores 
  the normal \em and \emph behavior.
